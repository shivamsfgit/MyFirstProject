<!--Here, we are declaring the fields in fieldsArray(in JS) property that we want to use. Instead of declaring fields 
we could have also used "layout-type" property and we could give it "Full" or "Compact" as value.
Ex: layout-type="Full" in place of fileds={fieldsArray}. If we give "Full" as layout-item's value then
our form will load all the fields which are there in the full page layout and if we give compact as value then
our record type will only pick those fields which are present in the compact layout.

If we are layout-type then we don't need to declare any fields in our js.

It is preferrable to record-form when we want to create or view any existing record because less js is needed
,no complex markup is needed and everything is being taken care by just "lightning-record-form"-->
